# 🎯 Task: Implement Milestone 7 - Documentation & User Experience (Issue #8)

## 📋 Quick Context
You're working on the **cctoast-wsl** project - a utility that enables Windows toast notifications from WSL for Claude Code hooks. This milestone focuses on creating comprehensive, user-friendly documentation that makes the project accessible to developers and end users.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Git Worktree Setup (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Navigate to the main project directory
cd /home/liam/code/cctoast-wsl

# Create a new worktree for your work (avoid conflicts with other agents)
git worktree add worktree-issue8 main

# Switch to your worktree
cd worktree-issue8

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/8-documentation-user-experience

# Assign yourself to the issue
gh issue edit 8 --add-assignee @me
```

### 2. Project Familiarization
Read these key files to understand the project:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context and development guidelines
- `docs/PRD.md` - Complete Product Requirements Document
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - 8-milestone roadmap
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md` - **CRITICAL** - Writing guidelines
- `docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md` - Git workflow and commit conventions
- Current `README.md` - See what needs enhancement

## 🎯 Your Mission: Issue #8 - Milestone 7: Documentation & User Experience

## 📚 Key Requirements & Guidelines

### Documentation Style (CRITICAL)
**MUST follow `docs/DOCUMENTATION_STYLE_GUIDE.md`** - This defines:
- Visual formatting techniques (alerts, code blocks, tables)
- Scannable content structure
- Use of markdown features for engagement
- Appropriate tone and style

### Content Structure Pattern
For each document, use this structure:
```markdown
# Document Title

Quick overview paragraph

## Quick Start / TL;DR
[Immediate value for impatient users]

## Detailed Sections
[Comprehensive information]

## Troubleshooting
[Common issues and solutions]

## References
[Links to related docs]
```

### CLI Flags Table (for README)
Use the complete table from `docs/PRD.md` Section 4, formatted as:
```markdown
| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--global/-g` | ✓ | Install to `~/.claude/...` |
| `--local/-l` | | Install to `.claude/...` |
[Continue with all 14 flags...]
```

## 🔄 Git Workflow (CRITICAL - Follow Exactly)

### Commit Conventions
Use **conventional commits** for automatic versioning:
```bash
# Documentation commits
git commit -m "docs: enhance README with badges and quick start

- Add CI, coverage, and npm badges
- Write 2-minute quick start section
- Include complete CLI flags table
- Add troubleshooting section links

Refs #8"

# Individual document commits
git commit -m "docs: create comprehensive FAQ document

- Document top 10 anticipated issues
- Add PowerShell troubleshooting section
- Include BurntToast installation problems
- Use clear problem-solution format

Refs #8"
```

### Testing Documentation
```bash
# Check markdown formatting
npm run lint:markdown  # if available

# Review each document for:
# - Spelling and grammar
# - Link accuracy
# - Code example correctness
# - Formatting consistency

# Test any code examples you include
./scripts/show-toast.sh --help  # verify commands work
```

### Progress Tracking
Update the issue regularly:
```bash
gh issue comment 8 --body "📋 **Progress Update**:
- [x] Enhanced README with badges and quick start
- [x] Created comprehensive FAQ document
- [ ] Working on manual installation guide
- [ ] Next: Security documentation

**ETA**: On track for 2-day estimate"
```

## 📝 Content Guidelines & Examples

### README Quick Start Example
```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Install**: `npx @claude/cctoast-wsl`
2. **Test**: Run Claude Code - notifications appear automatically
3. **Done**: Toast notifications now work from WSL!

> [!TIP]  
> Installation completes in under 30 seconds
```

### FAQ Entry Example
```markdown
### ❌ Problem: "PowerShell execution policy" error

**Symptom**: Installation fails with execution policy restrictions

**Solution**:
1. Open PowerShell as your user (not admin)
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`
3. Retry installation: `npx @claude/cctoast-wsl`

**Why this works**: Sets policy for current user only, doesn't require admin rights
```

### Security Documentation Example
```markdown
## Threat Model

### Trust Boundaries
- **WSL → Windows**: Controlled via PowerShell execution
- **User → System**: No elevation required
- **Network**: No network operations performed

### Mitigations
- Input sanitization prevents PowerShell injection
- User-scope installation (no system-wide changes)
- No postinstall scripts in package.json
```

## 🎨 Visual Enhancement

### Badges for README
Include these badge categories (URLs will be updated when CI is set up):
```markdown
[![CI Status](https://github.com/claudes-world/cctoast-wsl/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/claudes-world/cctoast-wsl/actions)
[![Coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/claudes-world/cctoast-wsl/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/claudes-world/cctoast-wsl)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40claude%2Fcctoast-wsl.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@claude/cctoast-wsl)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
```

### Use Markdown Features
- **Alerts**: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!TIP]`
- **Code blocks**: Always specify language
- **Tables**: For structured information
- **Collapsible sections**: For optional details

## 🧪 Content Validation

### Documentation Testing Checklist
- [ ] All links work (especially internal doc links)
- [ ] Code examples are accurate and tested
- [ ] Installation steps are complete and correct
- [ ] Troubleshooting covers real scenarios

### User Experience Test
Ask yourself:
- Can a new user install in under 2 minutes using README?
- Does FAQ cover the issues they'll actually hit?
- Is troubleshooting actionable (not just "check your config")?
- Would you use this documentation if you found the project?
