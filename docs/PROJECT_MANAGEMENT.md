# Project Management Guide for LLM Development

This document provides comprehensive guidance for LLM developers (like Claude Code) working on the cctoast-wsl project. Follow these workflows to ensure consistent, traceable, and high-quality development.

## 🎯 Overview

The cctoast-wsl project uses **GitHub Issues → Feature Branches → Pull Requests → Main Branch** workflow with milestone tracking and comprehensive labeling.

### Key Principles
1. **All work starts with an issue** - Never code without a corresponding GitHub issue
2. **One feature per branch** - Keep branches focused and small
3. **Descriptive commits** - Use conventional commits for automatic versioning
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Maintain 90% test coverage
5. **Documentation updates** - Update docs with code changes

---

## 📋 Issue Management Workflow

### Before Starting Any Work

#### 1. Issue Selection
```bash
# View all open issues
gh issue list

# View issues by milestone
gh issue list --milestone "Foundation & Build System"

# View issues by label
gh issue list --label "P0-critical"
```

#### 2. Issue Assignment
```bash
# Assign issue to yourself
gh issue edit <issue-number> --add-assignee @me

# Example:
gh issue edit 2 --add-assignee @me
```

#### 3. Issue Analysis
Read the issue completely and verify:
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear
- [ ] Dependencies are understood
- [ ] Required documentation is available
- [ ] Effort estimate aligns with available time

### Issue Status Tracking

Update issue status by commenting:
```bash
# Mark as in progress
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "🚧 **Status Update**: Starting work on this milestone

**Current Task**: Project Directory Structure
**ETA**: 2 hours
**Dependencies**: None"

# Progress updates
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "✅ **Progress Update**: 
- [x] Create directories
- [x] Move show-toast.sh to scripts/
- [ ] Create placeholder files
- [ ] Verify directory structure"

# Completion
gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "✅ **Completed**: All acceptance criteria met
**Next**: Ready for code review
**Testing**: All tests passing
**Docs**: Updated as needed"
```

## 🌿 Feature Branching Strategy

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>/<issue-number>-<short-description>

Types:
- feat/     - New features (milestone implementations)
- fix/      - Bug fixes
- docs/     - Documentation updates
- test/     - Test additions/improvements
- chore/    - Maintenance tasks
```

### Starting a Feature

#### 1. Create and Switch to Feature Branch
```bash
# Example for Milestone 1 (Issue #2)
git checkout -b feat/2-foundation-build-system

# Example for a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/15-powershell-escaping-issue

# Example for documentation
git checkout -b docs/12-update-installation-guide
```

#### 2. Link Branch to Issue
```bash
# Comment on issue to link branch
gh issue comment 2 --body "🌿 **Branch Created**: \`feat/2-foundation-build-system\`
Starting development on this milestone."
```

### Branch Management Rules
1. **Keep branches small** - Target 1-3 days of work maximum
2. **One milestone per branch** - Don't mix milestones
3. **Regular commits** - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
4. **Stay current** - Regularly rebase on main if long-running

---

## 💻 Development Workflow

### 1. Task Breakdown
For milestone issues, work through tasks in order:
```bash
# Update issue with current task
gh issue comment 2 --body "📋 **Current Task**: TypeScript Configuration
**Status**: In Progress
**Files**: tsconfig.json, package.json"
```

### 2. Commit Strategy
Use conventional commits for automatic versioning:
```bash
# Feature commits
git commit -m "feat: add TypeScript configuration with strict mode

- Enable strict type checking flags
- Configure ES2022 target
- Set up source maps for debugging
- Add path mapping for clean imports

Refs #2"

# Fix commits
git commit -m "fix: resolve PowerShell parameter escaping issue

Special characters in toast messages were causing PowerShell 
command execution to fail. Added proper escaping function.

Closes #15"

# Documentation commits  
git commit -m "docs: update installation guide with new directory structure

Added section for scripts/ directory organization
Updated file paths throughout guide

Refs #12"
```

### 3. Testing Requirements
Before any commit:
```bash
# Run all checks
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:coverage

# Check coverage meets requirements (90%)
# If coverage drops, add tests before committing
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
Update relevant documentation:
- **CLAUDE.md** - For LLM context changes
- **README.md** - For user-facing changes
- **Architecture docs** - For design changes
- **API docs** - For interface changes

## 🧪 Collaborative Testing Protocol

### When to Request User Testing

Before closing milestones that include interactive or system-dependent features, create a `PLEASE-TEST-<issue-number>.md` file for user validation.

#### Features Requiring User Testing:
- Interactive prompts (@clack/prompts)
- TTY detection logic  
- Signal handling (Ctrl+C)
- Color output
- Terminal-specific behaviors
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Features that behave differently in CI vs interactive environments

#### Testing File Creation Process:

```bash
# Create test file for issue #3
# File: PLEASE-TEST-3.md

# Include in the file:
# 1. Environment requirements (WSL, interactive terminal, etc.)
# 2. Pre-test setup commands
# 3. Numbered test cases with expected behaviors
# 4. Visual quality assessment criteria
# 5. Clear reporting format (✅/❌ for each test)
```

#### Test File Template Structure:
```markdown
# 🧪 PLEASE TEST: Issue #X - [Feature Name]

## Environment Requirements
- Specific environment needed (WSL, Windows, terminal type)

## Pre-Test Setup  
- Commands to prepare for testing

## Test Cases
### ✅ Test N: [Test Name]
**Command:** `command to run`
**Expected Behavior:** What should happen
**Report:** ✅/❌ [Question to answer]

## Reporting Results
- Clear format for user to provide feedback
```

### User Testing Workflow

1. **LLM Creates Test File**: When feature is "implementation complete"
2. **Request User Testing**: Comment on issue with link to test file
3. **User Performs Testing**: Follow test file instructions
4. **User Reports Results**: Comment with ✅/❌ results and feedback
5. **LLM Addresses Issues**: Fix any problems found
6. **Milestone Closure**: Only close when user testing passes

### Example Test Request Comment:

```bash
gh issue comment 3 --body "🧪 **User Testing Required**

Implementation is complete but needs validation in a real terminal environment.

**Test File**: [PLEASE-TEST-3.md](./PLEASE-TEST-3.md)

**Why Testing Needed**: Interactive prompts, TTY detection, and signal handling cannot be fully tested in Claude Code environment.

**Please test when convenient and report results. Will wait for your validation before closing this milestone.**"
```

### Post-Testing Actions

```bash
# After successful testing
gh issue comment 3 --body "✅ **User Testing Complete** - All test cases passed
Ready to close milestone"

# If issues found
gh issue comment 3 --body "🔧 **Issues Found in Testing** 
Will address the following problems:
- [List issues found]
- [ETA for fixes]"
```

---

## 🚨 Error Handling and Recovery

### When Issues Are Blocked
```bash
# Mark as blocked
gh issue comment 15 --body "🚫 **Status**: Blocked

**Blocker**: Waiting for BurntToast module documentation
**Impact**: Cannot complete PowerShell integration testing
**Workaround**: Proceeding with mock implementation
**Resolution Needed**: Official BurntToast API documentation
**ETA**: Unknown - external dependency"

# Add blocked label
gh issue edit 15 --add-label "blocked"
```

### When Features Need to be Cancelled
```bash
# Cancel feature
gh issue comment 20 --body "❌ **Feature Cancelled**

**Reason**: Requirement changed during development
**Work Completed**: 60% implementation done
**Disposition**: Code archived in branch \`feat/20-cancelled-feature\`
**Impact**: No impact on current milestone timeline"

# Close issue
gh issue close 20 --reason "not planned"
```

### When PRs Need to be Rejected
```bash
# Close PR without merging
gh pr close 25 --comment "❌ **PR Closed Without Merge**

**Reason**: Architecture approach doesn't align with project goals
**Action Required**: New implementation needed with different approach
**Issue Status**: Reopened for alternative solution"

# Reopen related issue if needed
gh issue reopen 18
```

---

## 🎨 Labels and Organization

### Applying Labels During Development
```bash
# Add labels to track work
gh issue edit 2 --add-label "milestone,P0-critical,foundation,M"

# Update labels as work progresses
gh issue edit 2 --add-label "in-progress"
gh issue edit 2 --remove-label "P0-critical" --add-label "P1-high"
```

### Label Usage Guidelines
- **Priority**: Always set P0-P3 based on current urgency
- **Component**: Tag with relevant system component
- **Type**: Specify work type (feature, enhancement, bug, docs)
- **Effort**: Estimate using XS, S, M, L, XL
- **Status**: Use in-progress, blocked, review-needed as appropriate
