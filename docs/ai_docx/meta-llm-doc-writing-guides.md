I had 4 agents (you plus 3 others) all review Versions 1 & 2 and redraft what they thought would make the best guide.

Please review the 4 newly drafted versions (3-6).

# LLM-Optimized Documentation Framework

Write docs that maximize information density while minimizing token usage.

## The 20-60-20 Structure

**20% Context** - Constraints, prerequisites, and essential warnings
**60% Commands** - Copy-pasteable code with inline annotations  
**20% Reference** - Current state, common patterns, edge cases

## 5 Core Rules + Implementation

### 1. Lead with Blockers
Start with what doesn't work or critical prerequisites:
```
"GitHub CLI lacks native milestone commands. Use `gh api`..."
"Requires admin permissions. Non-admins see 403 errors."
```

### 2. Commands with Context
```bash
# List milestones - includes closed by default
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones          # GET - all milestones
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones?state=open  # GET - active only

# Update milestone - preserves unspecified fields  
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones/1 \      # PATCH
  --method PATCH --field title="v1.0 Release"
```

### 3. Progressive Complexity
Basic → Advanced → Power-user in same section:
```bash
# Basic: list milestones
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones

# Advanced: filter and format
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[] | {number, title, open_issues}'

# Power: bulk operations
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --paginate | jq -r '.[].number' | \
  xargs -I {} gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones/{} -X DELETE
```

### 4. Real Data, Real State
Include actual project state inline:
```bash
# Current milestones (as of 2025-01-20):
# 1: "MVP" - 3 open issues
# 2: "Beta" - 0 open issues  
# 3: "v1.0" - 12 open issues
```

### 5. Cognitive Load Optimization
- One concept per line/block
- Consistent comment patterns: `# Action - detail`
- Group by workflow, not alphabetically
- Exit codes and errors inline: `# returns 404 if milestone deleted`

## Quality Gates

✓ **Copy-paste test**: Can every command run as-is?
✓ **Deletion test**: Is every section essential?
✓ **Scan test**: Can users find what they need in <5 seconds?
✓ **Context test**: Do commands include necessary warnings inline?

## Anti-patterns

❌ "This document explains..." - Skip preambles
❌ `<placeholder>` values - Use real examples
❌ Separate "Notes" sections - Integrate warnings inline
❌ Future tense - Use imperative: "List" not "To list"

Every token must provide immediate utility.
</version3>

<version4>

# **Ultra-Dense Doc Framework for LLM Agents**

Framework to maximize info density, minimize tokens: Front-load limits, command-focus, real data.

**15-70-15 Structure**
- 15% Constraint: 1-2 sentences on what doesn't work.
- 70% Commands: Copy-pasteable code with inline annotations (HTTP methods, warnings, exit codes).
- 15% Reference: Current state, gotchas, edge cases.

**Core Principles (Merged Rules)**
1. **Constraint-First**: Lead with essential limit/solution. E.g., "GitHub CLI lacks native milestones. Use `gh api`."
2. **Command-Centric**: Logical order (list → create → update → delete). Use real project data: milestone 1 ("1.0 Release", due 2025-03-31).
   ```bash
   # List (GET) milestones with key info
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[] | {number, title, due_on}'

   # Create (POST) milestone  
   gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST -f title="1.0 Release" -f due_on="2025-03-31T23:59:59Z"  # careful: no undo
   ```
3. **Inline Precision**: Technical details with commands (e.g., "# (PATCH) - updates all issues"). Warnings brief: "# error if duplicate title".
4. **Context-Aware Layering**: Essentials first, then progressive: basics → workflows → shortcuts. Use shorthand (e.g., "jq" for JSON query).
5. **Zero Fluff/Future-Proof**: No intros/overviews. Strip redundancies. Focus stable patterns; note versions only if critical.
6. **Cognitive Optimization**: Consistent patterns (e.g., uniform comments). Group by workflow. Real data for nuances/pitfalls.

**Quick Reference Table**
| Milestone # | Title | Due Date | Issues Assigned |
|-------------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 1          | 1.0 Release | 2025-03-31 | 5              |
| 2          | Bug Fix Sprint | 2025-04-15 | 3              |

**Quality Gates**
- Copy-pasteable? Uses real data/integrated details?
- Deletable test: Remove any line—lose essential info?
- Scannable: Predictable structure, minimal whitespace.

**Before/After Example**
Before (fluffy): "Introduction: Milestones track progress..."
After (dense): "No native CLI milestones. Use `gh api`. # List (GET) ..."

Every token earns utility: Dense, adaptable, low cognitive load.

# Hybrid Version: The Agent-Centric Documentation (ACD) Framework

Here is a hybrid version that combines the actionable structure of Version 1 with the conceptual depth of Version 2, refactored for maximum clarity and utility.

# The Agent-Centric Documentation (ACD) Framework

A guide for writing token-efficient documentation that is optimized for Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The goal is to maximize utility and clarity while minimizing context window usage.

### Core Principles

1.  **Context-First:** Front-load the most critical limitation or context. An agent must immediately know the "gotcha" or the reason these specific commands are necessary.
2.  **Command-Centric:** The core of the document must be actionable, copy-pasteable commands. The primary purpose is to enable action, not to educate on theory.
3.  **Zero Ceremony:** Eliminate all conversational fluff. No introductions, overviews, or conclusions. Every token must serve a direct purpose in understanding or executing a task.
4.  **Cognitive Efficiency:** Structure information for immediate parsing. Use consistent patterns, logical grouping, and inline annotations so the agent can understand the purpose and risk of a command without processing extra prose.

### The 15-70-15 Structure

A document should be proportioned to prioritize action over exposition.

  * **15% Constraint & Problem:** State the core problem or limitation that necessitates this guide. (e.g., "Native tool lacks a feature," "API has a critical nuance").
  * **70% Commands & Implementation:** Provide logically ordered, copy-pasteable code blocks with concise, inline technical annotations. This is the working core of the document.
  * **15% Reference & State:** Include essential reference data, like current project IDs, version states, or critical warnings that apply globally.

### Actionable Writing Rules

1.  **Lead with the Constraint:** Start with the single most important piece of information.

    > **Correct:** `GitHub CLI doesn't have native milestone commands. Use 'gh api' for direct repository interaction.`
    > **Incorrect:** `This document will explain how to use the GitHub API to manage milestones.`

2.  **Structure Commands Logically:** Group commands in a natural workflow (e.g., List → Create → View → Update → Delete). This follows the principle of **Progressive Enhancement**, guiding from basic to complex operations.

3.  **Annotate with Technical Precision Inline:** Embed necessary metadata directly as code comments. Don't separate the command from its explanation.

    ```bash
    # List (GET) all milestones with key info
    gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[] | {number, title}'

    # Create (POST) a new milestone with a due date
    # Fails if due date is in the past. Exit code 1.
    gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST \
      --field title="2.0 - Launch" \
      --field due_on="2025-10-31T23:59:59Z"

    # Delete (DELETE) a milestone. 
    # Careful: This is irreversible and removes it from all associated issues.
    gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones/15 --method DELETE
    ```

4.  **Use Real Data:** Use actual project data instead of abstract placeholders. This provides immediate, realistic context.

    > **Correct:** `# Update milestone 15`
    > **Incorrect:** `# Update milestone <milestone_id>`

### Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing, check if the document passes these tests:

  * **Is it copy-pasteable?** Can every single command be used directly without modification (other than environment variables)?
  * **Is it context-first?** Is the most important constraint in the first sentence?
  * **Is it ceremony-free?** Are there any headers like "Introduction," "Overview," or "Summary"? (Delete them).
  * **Is it deletable?** Could you remove any line, section, or comment without losing essential functional information? If yes, delete it.

### Example: Before vs. After ACD

**Before (Verbose, Human-Centric):**

```
## Introduction
This guide provides instructions for managing project milestones in GitHub using the command line. While the GitHub CLI is a powerful tool, it does not currently have dedicated commands for milestone management.

### How to List Milestones
To see the current milestones in the repository, you can use the `gh api` command to query the REST API endpoint for milestones.
```

**After (Dense, Agent-Centric):**

```
GitHub CLI doesn't have native milestone commands. Use `gh api`.

# List (GET) all current milestones
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --jq '.[] | {number, title}'

# Current Project Milestones
# 15: "2.0 - Launch" (due 2025-10-31)
# 12: "1.1 - Hotfix" (due 2025-08-15)
```

One thing I think all of these re-drafted versions are missing is flexibility around the intent of the document. These are all command/tool focused.
This guide should be for writing all types of guideline documentation for LLM agents. This could be design style guides, coding style guides, guides for
how customer service agents should interact with customers, guides for how to follow structured processes, etc. 

Many of these guides will have zero commands or tools or code. The 15-70-15 (or 20-60-20) ratio is a good idea, but the middle section needs to be more flexible based on the guide type.

We are creating a guide for how to write any type of document to prime LLM context with important task-specific information, but we need it to be flexible enough for any possible task type.

All 4 reviewers agreed that Version 1 (from the original 2 drafts I shared) was best, but I disagree. I liked the compact/concise nature of Version 1, 
but I think it's far too rigid by being prescriptive instead of descriptive. Version 2 helped agents understand the intent behind creating an information-dense LLM guide,
giving our (super smart) agents the autonomy to write a guide that is tailored to any number of specific needs. Principles instead of rules mean the writer/agent will be able to use it's own judgement to determine the best way to write the guide for a specific task.

This guide is the perfect example. Version 1 (and 3, 4, 5, and 6) would all be poor instructions for writing *this guide*. The flexibility of Version 2 (while too verbose - it was drafted more as a reflection on what has worked for a recent doc) 
would have been the best of the 6 drafts - in my opinion - for telling us how to write *this LLM context-priming document* (very meta hahaha).

Please review the 4 newly drafted versions (3-6), then think about why I think the original Version 2 was the most effective.

Now what you better understand the context, do you agree with me that Version 2 is the best of the 6 drafts, Given the open-ended nature and multi-utility we need to cover?

Don't be too affaid to add section headers or more examples. 
We should say "for technical docs write commands like this", "for process docs write instructions like XYZ", "for guideline docs follow this structure". 
(I did like the examples versions 1, 3-6 have, but they are only relevant for some types of dense docs) 
-- or just keep things higher level so writes/agents can use their own judgement.

---

Help draft a new version that combines prescriptive and descriptive elements to create a more effective guide.

---

hmmm, hold on, I wonder if we should have a parent guide with principles, that references the child guides targeting more specific task types. hmmm.... I think that is overkill and not as useful a structure....


----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------


I think we are still missing an important piece. These instructions shouldn't only be for writing a 
standalone document. It should be for writing anything that is meant as reference material for future LLM conversations.

We might have one large guide that is broken into sections. (Headers and sections are not always bad, they must just
be used strategically for effective organization and readability.)

Maybe this guide will be used for telling an agent how to add a new section about repository structure and naming conventions,
inside our existing, larger coding guidelines doc. Or maybe we are creating a prompt template for a new research agent. 
Or maybe we are updating an existing guidelines for customer service workflow to include a new decision making step.

> note: verbosity is not always bad, especially when providing rich examples and context. it is a balancing act between 
> minimizing token waste with fluff and providing clear, actionable instructions, and detailed examples.

These guidelines we are drafting now need to help remind the writing agent to think about organization, present relevant info and strip fluff,
focus on minimizing cognitive load and unnecessary token usage. Maybe the writer/agent must reduce ambiguity or maybe the agent 
must trigger open-ended thinking to help future consumers.

I like the structured approach of:
1. front-loading the most important information
2. giving actionable instructions, guidelines, frameworks, commands. Structuring information into logical groups. Delivering 
    immediate value first and working towards more advanced techniques and edge cases. Using real data and examples. Providing reference data, common patterns, edge cases, gotchas, etc.

This structure is good for overall document structure, but is is also good for structuring individual sections within a larger document.

We can essentially be nesting this structure within itself. It follows a tell-show-explain[-recap] pattern. Or headline-body-footer (and within the body, we can have a tell-show-explain[-recap] pattern).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Here is what I think



* Intents is better than use cases when framing things. "Intent to provoke open-ended thought" is the most important thing we want to be getting the agents to do. We are trying to trigger an agent to think a certain way, not follow a rigid process that limits creativity and situationally-aware bispoke tailored approaches for every different situation (the agent is better to make more decisions itself. we can never properly plan how to perform every task)



* Overall style and high-level "theoretical" ideas from the FIFA version should be presented earlier. This is more important for properly priming agent context to get into the right mind set to solve the problem itself. 



* Defining success should not come in the body. It is a great idea, but must not appear too early. We want to prep a *mindset* of writing efficient LLM-facing documents. Build the mindset before triggering the agent to start thinking about outcomes/goals. (Agents are too easy to start solving problems)



* The stronger, more concrete and more prescriptive ideas and examples from Claude draft should fill out the later part of the doc. 



<my-outline>
# Title & Opening Philosophy
Purpose: "Guidelines for writing docs that are primarily LLM-facing (read by AI agents) that are well organized, informationally dense, and efficient."
Format: Brief manifesto-style opening (2-3 sentences)
Content: Position as a thinking framework, not rigid rules
Justification: FIFA's "thinking tool" approach gives writers agency while our practical focus keeps it grounded. 

---

Guiding Principles
Content:

Present a small set of high-level, universal principles that govern all decisions.

1. Intentionality First: Define your goal before you write (Constrain, Guide, or Provoke). This is FIFA's key strategic contribution.

2. Strategic Information Density: Frame verbosity as a value proposition (from the alternative draft). Contrast a bad, vague example with a good, detailed one.

3. Headers as Navigation: State the rule: Headers are for searchability and structure, not ceremony.

4. Progressive Disclosure: Introduce this as a core principle for managing complexity within any section (from the alternative draft).

Presentation:

Use a numbered list with bolded titles. Each principle should have a one-sentence summary followed by a brief explanatory paragraph or example.

Justification: This section provides the "rules of thumb" that guide the writer's judgment. It synthesizes the most powerful, abstract concepts from both drafts into a single, actionable list.

---


Core Concept - The Fractal Structure
Format: Visual diagram + explanation
Content:

Introduce the "Information Unit" (simpler than "molecule")
Show how units nest: Document > Section > Subsection > Paragraph
Visual example of the same pattern at different scales

Justification: Both drafts agree this is fundamental; visual representation makes it instantly clear

---

Start with a one-sentence mission statement: "A guide for creating reference material that enables an LLM to understand context, act correctly, and avoid errors."

Define success from the LLM's perspective (borrowed from the alternative draft):

Can it extract relevant information quickly?

Can it apply the information correctly in context?

Can it avoid predictable errors?

Explicitly state the "Thinking Tool, Not a Rulebook" philosophy (from FIFA).

Presentation:

Use a callout box or blockquote for the mission statement to make it stand out.

Justification: This combines the alternative draft's brilliant "define success first" approach with FIFA's strong philosophical framing. It immediately sets the right tone and focus for the reader.

---

The Universal Pattern
Format: Simple 3-part structure
Content:

Context (What/Why) - The constraint or purpose
Content (How) - The actionable material
Clarification (When/Where) - Edge cases, references

Justification: Simpler than FIFA's Headline/Body/Footer or Claude's Tell/Show/Explain/Recap, but captures the essence

~~~

Three Intent Modes
Format: Equal-weight presentation of three approaches
Content:
Mode 1: CONSTRAIN (Reduce Ambiguity)

When to use: Technical docs, APIs, compliance
Techniques: Imperative commands, if/then logic
Example: API endpoint documentation

Mode 2: GUIDE (Provide Heuristics)

When to use: Style guides, best practices, principles
Techniques: Do/Don't patterns, examples with reasoning
Example: Design system documentation

Mode 3: EXPLORE (Stimulate Thinking)

When to use: Research briefs, creative prompts, strategy docs
Techniques: Open questions, constraints, analogies
Example: Innovation workshop prompt

Justification: FIFA's three intents are brilliant; "Explore" is clearer than "Provoke"

---

Practical Applications
Format: Scenario-based mini-guides
Content:

Writing a Complete Document
Adding a Section to Existing Docs
Creating Prompt Templates
Updating/Revising Material
Building Reference Libraries

Justification: Our draft's strength was acknowledging different contexts; this preserves that

---

The Verbosity Balance: Justifying Token Cost
Content:

Create a dedicated section to expand on the "Strategic Density" principle.

Use a clear T-chart or two-column layout to contrast "Good Verbosity" (value-adding) vs. "Bad Verbosity" (fluff).

Good Verbosity: Multiple examples, context that prevents errors, step-by-step breakdowns.

Bad Verbosity: Restating the obvious, generic statements, academic theory for practical tasks.

Include the excellent variable naming example from the alternative draft.

Presentation:

A Markdown table would be perfect for the two-column comparison.

Justification: Pulling this out into its own section elevates its importance. The cost-benefit analysis of tokens is a central challenge for LLM writers, and this section tackles it head-on with clear, unambiguous examples.

~~~

The Token Economy
Format: Principles with examples
Content:

Strategic Verbosity (when detail adds value)
Structural Efficiency (headers as navigation)
Progressive Disclosure (basic → advanced)
Contextual Density (matching environment)

Justification: Combines FIFA's "Value-Driven Verbosity" with our practical token-saving techniques

---

Quality Heuristics
Format: Checklist questions, not rules
Content:

Can an LLM find what it needs quickly?
Is the intent (constrain/guide/explore) clear from each first sentence?
Does structure match purpose?
Would removing any part lose essential value?


Combine the best questions from both drafts:

Intent: Is the primary goal clear from each section's first sentence?

Findability: Can a user/LLM quickly locate the relevant section?

Applicability: Is it clear when and how to apply this guidance?

Completeness: Are the most common edge cases addressed?

Efficiency: Has all low-value "ceremony" text been deleted?

Conclude with the "Meta-Application" note, explaining how the guide itself follows these rules.

Presentation:

Use a Markdown checklist (- [ ]) to make it feel like an actionable tool.

Justification: This provides a simple, effective quality gate and reinforces the guide's principles by showing they've been applied to the guide itself, ending on a strong, confident note.

Justification: Questions encourage thinking vs. rigid gates/rules

---

Examples Gallery
Format: Side-by-side comparisons across domains
Content:

Technical: API documentation
Process: Customer service workflow
Creative: Design brief
Analytical: Research template
Show the same fractal pattern in each

Justification: Our concrete examples + FIFA's diversity of intents

---


Meta Note
Format: Brief closing that references the document itself
Content: "This guide demonstrates its own principles: clear intent (guide), fractal structure, strategic verbosity where helpful"
Justification: Both drafts did this well; it's a powerful teaching tool

</my-outline>

Key Design Decisions:

No rigid percentages: Neither 15-70-15 nor 15-80-5, just proportional thinking
"Unit" over "Molecule": Less jargon, same concept
Three equal modes: Elevates creative/exploratory use cases to equal standing
Questions over rules: Encourages judgment rather than compliance
Practical focus with philosophical grounding: Best of both approaches
Gallery approach: Shows pattern across radically different content types
