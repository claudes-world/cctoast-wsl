## Git and GitHub Guidelines

### Mandatory GitHub Practices
- **ALWAYS sign all GitHub comments and messages**
  - Ensures clear attribution and accountability
  - Helps track individual contributions
  - Demonstrates professional communication

### Required Signature Format
All git commits, GitHub issue comments, and PR comments must include:
```
ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude-do <claude@claude.do>, Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## üß™ Interactive Feature Testing Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Before closing any milestone that includes interactive/TTY features, ALWAYS request user validation in a real terminal environment. The Claude Code environment cannot fully test interactive prompts, TTY detection, or terminal-specific behaviors.

### When to Request User Testing
- Interactive prompts (@clack/prompts)
- TTY detection logic
- Signal handling (Ctrl+C)
- Color output
- Progress indicators
- Any feature that behaves differently in CI vs interactive environments

### Testing Instructions Template
When requesting user testing, provide specific instructions:
1. **Commands to run**: Exact command-line invocations
2. **Expected behavior**: What the user should see and experience
3. **Edge cases**: Ctrl+C handling, invalid inputs, etc.
4. **Environment notes**: WSL vs native terminal requirements

### Testing Workflow:
1. **Create** `user_testing/PLEASE-TEST-<issue-number>.md` file with comprehensive test instructions. Commit and push.
2. **Tag @mcorrig4** in issue comment with friendly testing request and test file link
3. **Prompt**: also tell the user the same instructions through a message. Include a link to the issue comment at the end of your message.
4. **Wait** for user validation before closing milestone
4. **Address** any issues found and re-test if needed

### Partner Collaboration:
- **Always tag @mcorrig4** as your development partner for testing
- Use friendly, conversational tone (not formal/robotic)
- Clearly explain what you need and why
- Set realistic expectations and timeframes
- Thank them for collaboration - never pressure

### Example Files Created:
- `user_testing/PLEASE-TEST-3.md` - Interactive CLI mode validation for Milestone 2
- Future: `user_testing/PLEASE-TEST-X.md` - BurntToast integration, PowerShell execution, etc.

### Standard Test File Sections:
- Environment requirements
- Pre-test setup commands  
- Numbered test cases with ‚úÖ/‚ùå reporting
- Visual quality assessment
- Clear result reporting format

## Project Overview

cctoast-wsl is a utility that enables Windows toast notifications with sounds, messages, titles, and images from inside WSL for Claude Code hooks. It bridges WSL and Windows using PowerShell's BurntToast module.

## Development Commands

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test
```
Note: Currently no tests are implemented (exits with error).

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test the notification script directly
./show-toast.sh --title "Test" --message "Testing notification"
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Bash Wrapper (show-toast.sh)**
   - Parses command-line arguments (--title, --message, --image, --attribution)
   - Converts WSL paths to Windows paths using `wslpath`
   - Escapes PowerShell special characters
   - Invokes PowerShell with BurntToast module

2. **NPM Package Structure**
   - Main entry: index.js (to be implemented)
   - Install script: Will create wrapper executable in ~/.claude/cctoast-wsl/ or .claude/cctoast-wsl/
   - Hook integration: Updates Claude Code settings.json with notification/stop hooks

3. **Hook Commands**
   - Notification hook: `cctoast-wsl --notification-hook`
   - Stop hook: `cctoast-wsl --stop-hook`

## Implementation Requirements

### Dependency Checks
The installer must verify:
- WSL environment (fatal if not present)
- `powershell.exe` in PATH (fatal if missing)
- PowerShell execution policy (warning if restrictive)
- BurntToast module installed (fatal if missing)
- `jq` binary (optional, warn if missing)
- Claude directory exists (warn if missing)

### Installation Logic
- Global install: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Local install: `.claude/settings.local.json` (or `settings.json` if --sync)
- Atomic JSON merge with backup creation
- Preserve existing hooks while adding new ones

### Security Considerations
- No postinstall scripts in package.json
- All scripts must have 0o500 permissions
- Refuse to run as root
- Manual installation instructions required in docs/MANUAL.md

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No Node Runtime Dependency**: The actual notification script runs in pure Bash ‚Üí PowerShell
2. **Idempotent Installation**: Re-running installer should not duplicate hooks
3. **Atomic Operations**: All file writes use temp ‚Üí fsync ‚Üí rename pattern
4. **24-hour Cache**: Dependency check results cached in ~/.cache/cctoast-wsl/

## Future Implementation Tasks

Based on the PRD, the following components need to be implemented:
1. TypeScript CLI tool with esbuild bundling
2. JSON merge functionality with JSONC support
3. Interactive prompts for installation options
4. Comprehensive test suite (90% coverage target)
5. Documentation site with Docusaurus
6. CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Testing Approach

When tests are implemented:
- Unit tests: Vitest for TypeScript code
- Shell tests: Bats-core for bash scripts
- Integration tests: Mock BurntToast module on Windows CI
- Coverage: C8 with Codecov integration

## GitHub Issue Management

The project uses milestone-based GitHub issues to track all development work:

### Issue Structure
- **8 Milestone Issues (#2-#9)**: Each represents one of the 8 implementation milestones
- **Comprehensive Task Lists**: Each milestone issue contains detailed checkbox lists of all subtasks
- **Labels System**: Run `./scripts/labels.sh` to create the full labeling system for organization
- **Progress Tracking**: Use issue comments to provide regular progress updates

### Workflow for LLM Developers
1. **Select Issue**: Choose from milestone issues #2-#9 based on priority and dependencies
2. **Create Branch**: Use `feat/<issue-number>-<description>` naming convention
3. **Track Progress**: Update issue with comments as tasks are completed
4. **Create PR**: Link back to the milestone issue when ready for review
5. **Complete**: Close issue after successful merge


### MANDATORY LLM Agent Git Workflow

* **ALWAYS Manage Issue Assignment & Tagging**: Proper issue assignment prevents multiple agents working on the same task
* **IMPORTANT**: If you are not currently working on an issue **STOP!**. Ask the user which issue we are working on
* **CRITICAL**: LLM agents **MUST** create isolated worktrees before starting any work to prevent conflicts
```bash
# 1. Find available issue
gh issue list --assignee "" --state open
# To find a new issue to work on, make sure the label isn't "in-progress"

# 2. Set up worktree (get latest code first)
git fetch origin && git worktree add worktree-issue<N> origin/main && cd worktree-issue<N>

# 3. Assign issue and create branch
gh issue edit <N> --add-assignee @me
git checkout -b feat/<N>-<description>

# 4. Notify start of work
gh issue comment <N> --body "üöß Starting work in worktree-issue<N>"
gh issue edit <N> --label "in-progress"
```

**See @docs/PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md for complete workflow details.**

## Best Practices and Guidelines

- Avoid using emojis in docs unless told to
- **Use Glob, Search built-in tools, or Bash(rg) (ripgrep) instead of using grep and find**
