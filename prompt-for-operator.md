I am reviewing the planning docs you made:          │
│   @docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and                    │
│   @docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (based on @docs/PRD.md)       │
│                                                       │
│   I have some questions. Why did you split            │
│   cctoast-wsl CLI -> wrapper executable ->  bash      │
│   shim into 3 parts?                                  │
│                                                       │
│   At it's most basic level, isn't all we are doing    │
│   parting stdin (from the hook) can calling           │
│   powershell.exe to trigger the notification?         │
│                                                       │
│   You can see how I hacked toast notifications to     │
│   work in my current Claude Code hooks by looking at  │
│   @example-claude-settings.json                       │
│                                                       │
│   The purpose of this project is to make this useful  │
│   hook easy to share (and easy for my to setup on     │
│   multiple machines). I have already made a bash      │
│   script that does 75% of the functionality:          │
│   @show-toast.sh                                      │
│                                                       │
│   ---                                                 │
│                                                       │
│   However, I have never made an npm/npx package or    │
│   any open source app, so I do want to look good and  │
│   follow best design practices. Please help teach     │
│   me.                                                 │
│                                                       │
│   ---                                                 │
│                                                       │
│   Also, one other thing I noticed was missing. I      │
│   would like to install BurntToast for the user, if   │
│   they don't already have it installed. Is this       │
│   possible to from inside WSL using `powershell.exe   │
│   -Command ...`?   







------------------------------------------------------------
Great questions! You're absolutely right to
  question the 3-layer architecture - we're 
  over-engineering this.

  Looking at your existing solution, you already
  have the core working:
  - Your show-toast.sh script handles the actual
  notification logic perfectly
  - Your current Claude settings show a working
  (though complex) PowerShell command

  Simplified Architecture

  You're correct - at its core, we're just parsing
  hook input and calling powershell.exe. Here's a
  much simpler approach:

  2 Layers Instead of 3:
  1. CLI Installer (TypeScript/Node) - runs only
  during installation via npx
  2. Bash Script (your show-toast.sh) - the actual
  runtime component

  Remove the "wrapper executable" layer entirely.
  The Claude hook can directly call:
  ~/.claude/cctoast-wsl/show-toast.sh
  --notification-hook

  Auto-Installing BurntToast

  Yes! You can absolutely install BurntToast from
  WSL:

  powershell.exe -Command "Install-Module BurntToast
   -Scope CurrentUser -Force"

  We should add this to the installer's dependency
  checking phase:
  1. Check if BurntToast exists
  2. If not, prompt user: "Install BurntToast
  automatically? (y/N)"
  3. Run the install command if they agree

  NPM/Open Source Best Practices

  Your instincts about keeping it simple are exactly
   right. The key practices to follow:

  Security

  - ✅ No postinstall scripts (users run installer
  explicitly)
  - ✅ No elevated permissions needed
  - ✅ Scripts run with user permissions only

  Architecture

  - ✅ Separation of install-time vs runtime
  - ✅ Minimal runtime dependencies (just bash)
  - ✅ Clear, auditable code

  Quality

  - Good testing coverage
  - Clear documentation
  - Proper error handling
  - Semantic versioning

  Revised Simple Plan

  1. CLI Tool: TypeScript installer that:
    - Checks/installs dependencies (including
  BurntToast)
    - Copies your show-toast.sh to
  ~/.claude/cctoast-wsl/
    - Updates Claude settings with simple hook
  commands
  2. Runtime: Your existing bash script (with minor
  enhancements)
  3. Hook Commands:
  {
    "Notification":
  ["~/.claude/cctoast-wsl/show-toast.sh 
  --notification-hook"],
    "Stop": ["~/.claude/cctoast-wsl/show-toast.sh 
  --stop-hook"]
  }

  This is much simpler to implement and maintain
  while still following all the open source best
  practices. Your existing show-toast.sh does most
  of the heavy lifting already!

  Would you like me to help revise the
  implementation plan with this simplified
  architecture?

-------------------------------------------------------------

please update all of the planning documents. but 
  first, I need help researching all the json shemas
   for all the different claude code hooks, so we 
  can properly parse out the different useful pieces
   that could be captured in a notification (maybe 
  trigger different sounds for different types of 
  notifications (I can think of Notifications for 
  Bash requests, writing/editing files, doing web 
  searches, and calling MCP tools, and stop could 
  all have different toasts, depending on what info 
  we can capture from stdin json passed.

  I've searched pretty hard and can't find complete 
  documentation. Can you help me search for this 
  info? If that fails, I know how we could create a 
  test to figure it out outselves, but that's 
  annoying
